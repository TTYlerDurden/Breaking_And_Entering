# Breaking & Entering

This book has been an ongoing yet rewarding personal project I authored and designed as a pocket reference for professionals in the 
fields of cyber security and network administration. The book is intended to be a concise and comprehensive collection of technical information, tables, commands and techniques presented in a pared down desk companion. My goal was to produce an attractive, easy to navigate guide that could be just as helpful to security professionals as The Little Know It All: Common Sense For Designers is to graphic designers. What you see below is the initial printed edition which was a check for print quality and accuracies. I will be revising and producing the finalized edition to be available for purchase and pdf form (for easy grep-ing) in the very near future. 

Thanks for stopping by and looking at my latest work in progress!
